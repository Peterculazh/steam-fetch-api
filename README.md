### Remarks

- This package I created mostly for me. But I'm looking forward to continue develop it and improve both code and documentation;
- Steam API is not documented officially, so there poor list of endpoints that collected community. Feel free share to share it with me by creating issue;
- Currently I didn't faced request limits to Steam;
